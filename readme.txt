This is a simple to-do list demo app for Android.

How the app works:
- The home page has all the to do lists made by the user. A new list can be created by clicking the ”+” button on the nav bar.
- Clicking on this button will take the user to the ”todo list” page, where the list can be given a title. Items can also be added to the list here.
- Once a new list is created, it is listed in the home page. Clicking on it will take the user once again to the ”todo list” page once again, where the title and list can be edited.
- Each list can be deleted by swiping the cell left on the home page.
- A new list item can be created by clicking the ”+” button on the nav bar of the ”todo list” page.
- Each list has a list of items that can be checked off and on. They can also be deleted using by swiping the cell to the left.
- Each list item can be edited by clicking on it. This opens a dedicated page to edit the text of the item.
